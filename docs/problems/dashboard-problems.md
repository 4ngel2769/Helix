# Dashboard Problems

This document outlines the current issues and challenges with the Helix dashboard implementation.

## Authentication Issues

1. **Token Validation**: The current token validation process doesn't properly verify token expiration.
2. **Session Management**: Sessions are not being properly cleared on logout or timeout.
3. **OAuth Flow**: The OAuth callback doesn't handle errors gracefully when Discord authentication fails.

## Performance Issues

1. **Module Loading**: Dashboard loads all modules at once, causing slow initial load times.
2. **API Response Times**: Some API endpoints have slow response times, especially when fetching guild data.
3. **Resource Caching**: Lack of proper caching strategy for frequently accessed resources.

## UI/UX Issues

1. **Mobile Responsiveness**: Dashboard layout breaks on smaller screens and mobile devices.
2. **Accessibility**: Dashboard doesn't meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards for accessibility.
3. **Error Feedback**: Users don't receive clear feedback when operations fail.

## Security Concerns

1. **CSRF Protection**: Missing or inadequate Cross-Site Request Forgery protection.
2. **Rate Limiting**: No rate limiting on API endpoints, making the dashboard vulnerable to abuse.
3. **Permission Checks**: Insufficient permission validation on some dashboard actions.

## Integration Problems

1. **Discord API Sync**: Dashboard state sometimes becomes out of sync with Discord's API.
2. **Database Connection**: Occasional connection drops to MongoDB aren't handled gracefully.
3. **WebSocket Implementation**: Real-time updates are unreliable due to WebSocket connection issues.

## Feature Gaps

1. **Audit Logging**: No comprehensive audit log for dashboard actions.
2. **Backup & Restore**: Missing functionality to backup and restore bot configurations.
3. **Multi-Guild Management**: Limited ability to manage multiple guilds efficiently from a single view.

## Next Steps

1. Implement proper error handling throughout the dashboard routes
2. Add comprehensive logging for debugging purposes
3. Improve the authentication flow with proper token validation
4. Enhance the UI with better responsive design
5. Implement rate limiting on all API endpoints
